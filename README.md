# TransformersForKnowledgeTracing
Repository for computer science and engineering thesis on Knowledge Tracing using Transformers

Directory "Knowledge_Tracing" contains the work done, particularly relevant is file "Models_Summary_and_Ideas", in which I summarized graphically all papers models and wrote my personal suggestions/ideas.

In directory "Transformer_Models_Theory" I have collected papers on Transformers, used as ground truth.
