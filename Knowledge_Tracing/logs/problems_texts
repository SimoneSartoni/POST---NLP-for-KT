b"Businesses like to have memorable telephone numbers. One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase. For example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable TUT-GLOP. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing 310-GINO. Another way to make a telephone number memorable is to group the digits in a memorable way. You could order your pizza from Pizza Hut by calling their ``three tens'' number 3-10-10-10.The standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits with a hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. 888-1200). The keypad of a phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:A, B, and C map to 2D, E, and F map to 3G, H, and I map to 4J, K, and L map to 5M, N, and O map to 6P, R, and S map to 7T, U, and V map to 8W, X, and Y map to 9There is no mapping for Q or Z. Hyphens are not dialed, and can be added and removed as necessary. The standard form of TUT-GLOP is 888-4567, the standard form of 310-GINO is 310-4466, and the standard form of 3-10-10-10 is 310-1010.Two telephone numbers are equivalent if they have the same standard form. (They dial the same number.)Your company is compiling a directory of telephone numbers from local businesses. As part of the quality control process you want to check that no two (or more) businesses in the directory have the same telephone number."
b"How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated in the figure below."

b'Fred Mapper is considering purchasing some land in Louisiana to build his house on. In the process of investigating the land, he learned that the state of Louisiana is actually shrinking by 50 square miles each year, due to erosion caused by the Mississippi River. Since Fred is hoping to live in this house the rest of his life, he needs to know if his land is going to be lost to erosion.After doing more research, Fred has learned that the land that is being lost forms a semicircle. This semicircle is part of a circle centered at (0,0), with the line that bisects the circle being the X axis. Locations below the X axis are in the water. The semicircle has an area of 0 at the beginning of year 1. (Semicircle illustrated in the Figure.)'
b"Some people believe that there are three cycles in a person's life that start the day he or she is born. These three cycles are the physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles, and they have periods of lengths 23, 28, and 33 days, respectively. There is one peak in each period of a cycle. At the peak of a cycle, a person performs at his or her best in the corresponding field (physical, emotional or mental). For example, if it is the mental curve, thought processes will be sharper and concentration will be easier.Since the three cycles have different periods, the peaks of the three cycles generally occur at different times. We would like to determine when a triple peak occurs (the peaks of all three cycles occur in the same day) for any person. For each cycle, you will be given the number of days from the beginning of the current year at which one of its peaks (not necessarily the first) occurs. You will also be given a date expressed as the number of days from the beginning of the current year. You task is to determine the number of days from the given date to the next triple peak. The given date is not counted. For example, if the given date is 10 and the next triple peak occurs on day 12, the answer is 2, not 3. If a triple peak occurs on the given date, you should give the number of days to the next occurrence of a triple peak."
b"One measure of ``unsortedness'' in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out of order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence ``DAABEC'', this measure is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ``AACEDGG'' has only one inversion (E and D)---it is nearly sorted---while the sequence ``ZWQM'' has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be---exactly the reverse of sorted).You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences containing only the four letters A, C, G, and T). However, you want to catalog them, not in alphabetical order, but rather in order of ``sortedness'', from ``most sorted'' to ``least sorted''. All the strings are of the same length."
b'During his last sabbatical, professor M. A. Ya made a surprising discovery about the old Maya calendar. From an old knotted message, professor discovered that the Maya civilization used a 365 day long year, called Haab, which had 19 months. Each of the first 18 months was 20 days long, and the names of the months were pop, no, zip, zotz, tzec, xul, yoxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, koyab, cumhu. Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called uayet and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Maya believed that this month was unlucky, the court of justice was not in session, the trade stopped, people did not even sweep the floor.For religious purposes, the Maya used another calendar in which the year was called Tzolkin (holly year). The year was divided into thirteen periods, each 20 days long. Each day was denoted by a pair consisting of a number and the name of the day. They used 20 names: imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau and 13 numbers; both in cycles.Notice that each day has an unambiguous description. For example, at the beginning of the year the days were described as follows:1 imix, 2 ik, 3 akbal, 4 kan, 5 chicchan, 6 cimi, 7 manik, 8 lamat, 9 muluk, 10 ok, 11 chuen, 12 eb, 13 ben, 1 ix, 2 mem, 3 cib, 4 caban, 5 eznab, 6 canac, 7 ahau, and again in the next period 8 imix, 9 ik, 10 akbal . . .Years (both Haab and Tzolkin) were denoted by numbers 0, 1, : : : , where the number 0 was the beginning of the world. Thus, the first day was:Haab: 0. pop 0Tzolkin: 1 imix 0Help professor M. A. Ya and write a program for him to convert the dates from the Haab calendar to the Tzolkin calendar.'

b"Have you done any Philately lately?You have been hired by the Ruritanian Postal Service (RPS) to design their new postage software. The software allocates stamps to customers based on customer needs and the denominations that are currently in stock.Ruritania is filled with people who correspond with stamp collectors. As a service to these people, the RPS asks that all stamp allocations have the maximum number of different types of stamps in it. In fact, the RPS has been known to issue several stamps of the same denomination in order to please customers (these count as different types, even though they are the same denomination). The maximum number of different types of stamps issued at any time is twenty-five.To save money, the RPS would like to issue as few duplicate stamps as possible (given the constraint that they want to issue as many different types). Further, the RPS won't sell more than four stamps at a time."

For those who are not familiar with the original problem: from among n people, numbered 1, 2, . . ., n, standing in circle every mth is going to be executed and only the life of the last remaining person will be saved. Joseph was smart enough to choose the position of the last remaining person, thus saving his life to give us the message about the incident. For example when n = 6 and m = 5 then the people will be executed in the order 5, 4, 6, 2, 3 and 1 will be saved.Suppose that there are k good guys and k bad guys. In the circle the first k are good guys and the last k bad guys. You have to determine such minimal m that all the bad guys will be executed before the first good guy."
b'Sally Jones has a dozen Voyageur silver dollars. However, only eleven of the coins are true silver dollars; one coin is counterfeit even though its color and size make it indistinguishable from the real silver dollars. The counterfeit coin has a different weight from the other coins but Sally does not know if it is heavier or lighter than the real coins.Happily, Sally has a friend who loans her a very accurate balance scale. The friend will permit Sally three weighings to find the counterfeit coin. For instance, if Sally weighs two coins against each other and the scales balance then she knows these two coins are true. Now if Sally weighsone of the true coins against a third coin and the scales do not balance then Sally knows the third coin is counterfeit and she can tell whether it is light or heavy depending on whether the balance on which it is placed goes up or down, respectively.By choosing her weighings carefully, Sally is able to ensure that she will find the counterfeit coin with exactly three weighings.'
b'Marsha and Bill own a collection of marbles. They want to split the collection among themselves so that both receive an equal share of the marbles. This would be easy if all the marbles had the same value, because then they could just split the collection in half. But unfortunately, some of the marbles are larger, or more beautiful than others. So, Marsha and Bill start by assigning a value, a natural number between one and six, to each marble. Now they want to divide the marbles so that each of them gets the same total value. Unfortunately, they realize that it might be impossible to divide the marbles in this way (even if the total value of all marbles is even). For example, if there are one marble of value 1, one of value 3 and two of value 4, then they cannot be split into sets of equal value. So, they ask you to write a program that checks whether there is a fair partition of the marbles.'

For each person in this pool, defence and prosecution assign a grade from 0 to 20 indicating their preference for this person. 0 means total dislike, 20 on the other hand means that this person is considered ideally suited for the jury.Based on the grades of the two parties, the judge selects the jury. In order to ensure a fair trial, the tendencies of the jury to favour either defence or prosecution should be as balanced as possible. The jury therefore has to be chosen in a way that is satisfactory to both parties.We will now make this more precise: given a pool of n potential jurors and two values di (the defence's value) and pi (the prosecution's value) for each potential juror i, you are to select a jury of m persons. If J is a subset of {1,..., n} with m elements, then D(J ) = sum(dk) k belong to Jand P(J) = sum(pk) k belong to J are the total values of this jury for defence and prosecution.For an optimal jury J , the value |D(J) - P(J)| must be minimal. If there are several jurys with minimal |D(J) - P(J)|, one which maximizes D(J) + P(J) should be selected since the jury should be as ideal as possible for both parties.You are to write a program that implements this jury selection process and chooses an optimal jury given a set of candidates."
b'"Kronecker\'s Knumbers" is a little company that manufactures plastic digits for use in signs (theater marquees, gas station price displays, and so on). The owner and sole employee, Klyde Kronecker, keeps track of how many digits of each type he has used by maintaining an inventory book. For instance, if he has just made a sign containing the telephone number "5553141", he\'ll write down the number "5553141" in one column of his book, and in the next column he\'ll list how many of each digit he used: two 1s, one 3, one 4, and three 5s. (Digits that don\'t get used don\'t appear in the inventory.) He writes the inventory in condensed form, like this: "21131435".The other day, Klyde filled an order for the number 31123314 and was amazed to discover that the inventory of this number is the same as the number---it has three 1s, one 2, three 3s, and one 4! He calls this an example of a "self-inventorying number", and now he wants to find out which numbers are self-inventorying, or lead to a self-inventorying number through iterated application of the inventorying operation described below. You have been hired to help him in his investigations.Given any non-negative integer n, its inventory is another integer consisting of a concatenation of integers c1 d1 c2 d2 ... ck dk , where each ci and di is an unsigned integer, every ci is positive, the di satisfy 0<=d1<d2<...<dk<=9, and, for each digit d that appears anywhere in n, d equals di for some i and d occurs exactly ci times in the decimal representation of n. For instance, to compute the inventory of 5553141 we set c1 = 2, d1 = 1, c2 = 1, d2 = 3, etc., giving 21131435. The number 1000000000000 has inventory 12011 ("twelve 0s, one 1").An integer n is called self-inventorying if n equals its inventory. It is called self-inventorying after j steps (j>=1) if j is the smallest number such that the value of the j-th iterative application of the inventory function is self-inventorying. For instance, 21221314 is self-inventorying after 2 steps, since the inventory of 21221314 is 31321314, the inventory of 31321314 is 31123314, and 31123314 is self-inventorying.Finally, n enters an inventory loop of length k (k>=2) if k is the smallest number such that for some integer j (j>=0), the value of the j-th iterative application of the inventory function is the same as the value of the (j + k)-th iterative application. For instance, 314213241519 enters an inventory loop of length 2, since the inventory of 314213241519 is 412223241519 and the inventory of 412223241519 is 314213241519, the original number (we have j = 0 in this case).Write a program that will read a sequence of non-negative integers and, for each input value, state whether it is self-inventorying, self-inventorying after j steps, enters an inventory loop of length k, or has none of these properties after 15 iterative applications of the inventory function.'
b'A factory produces products packed in square packets of the same height h and of the sizes 1*1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4, 5*5, 6*6. These products are always delivered to customers in the square parcels of the same height h as the products have and of the size 6*6. Because of the expenses it is the interest of the factory as well as of the customer to minimize the number of parcels necessary to deliver the ordered products from the factory to the customer.

b"Businesses like to have memorable telephone numbers. One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase. For example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable TUT-GLOP. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing 310-GINO. Another way to make a telephone number memorable is to group the digits in a memorable way. You could order your pizza from Pizza Hut by calling their ``three tens'' number 3-10-10-10.The standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits with a hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. 888-1200). The keypad of a phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:A, B, and C map to 2D, E, and F map to 3G, H, and I map to 4J, K, and L map to 5M, N, and O map to 6P, R, and S map to 7T, U, and V map to 8W, X, and Y map to 9There is no mapping for Q or Z. Hyphens are not dialed, and can be added and removed as necessary. The standard form of TUT-GLOP is 888-4567, the standard form of 310-GINO is 310-4466, and the standard form of 3-10-10-10 is 310-1010.Two telephone numbers are equivalent if they have the same standard form. (They dial the same number.)Your company is compiling a directory of telephone numbers from local businesses. As part of the quality control process you want to check that no two (or more) businesses in the directory have the same telephone number."
b"How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated in the figure below."

b'Fred Mapper is considering purchasing some land in Louisiana to build his house on. In the process of investigating the land, he learned that the state of Louisiana is actually shrinking by 50 square miles each year, due to erosion caused by the Mississippi River. Since Fred is hoping to live in this house the rest of his life, he needs to know if his land is going to be lost to erosion.After doing more research, Fred has learned that the land that is being lost forms a semicircle. This semicircle is part of a circle centered at (0,0), with the line that bisects the circle being the X axis. Locations below the X axis are in the water. The semicircle has an area of 0 at the beginning of year 1. (Semicircle illustrated in the Figure.)'
b"Some people believe that there are three cycles in a person's life that start the day he or she is born. These three cycles are the physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles, and they have periods of lengths 23, 28, and 33 days, respectively. There is one peak in each period of a cycle. At the peak of a cycle, a person performs at his or her best in the corresponding field (physical, emotional or mental). For example, if it is the mental curve, thought processes will be sharper and concentration will be easier.Since the three cycles have different periods, the peaks of the three cycles generally occur at different times. We would like to determine when a triple peak occurs (the peaks of all three cycles occur in the same day) for any person. For each cycle, you will be given the number of days from the beginning of the current year at which one of its peaks (not necessarily the first) occurs. You will also be given a date expressed as the number of days from the beginning of the current year. You task is to determine the number of days from the given date to the next triple peak. The given date is not counted. For example, if the given date is 10 and the next triple peak occurs on day 12, the answer is 2, not 3. If a triple peak occurs on the given date, you should give the number of days to the next occurrence of a triple peak."
b"One measure of ``unsortedness'' in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out of order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence ``DAABEC'', this measure is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ``AACEDGG'' has only one inversion (E and D)---it is nearly sorted---while the sequence ``ZWQM'' has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be---exactly the reverse of sorted).You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences containing only the four letters A, C, G, and T). However, you want to catalog them, not in alphabetical order, but rather in order of ``sortedness'', from ``most sorted'' to ``least sorted''. All the strings are of the same length."
b'During his last sabbatical, professor M. A. Ya made a surprising discovery about the old Maya calendar. From an old knotted message, professor discovered that the Maya civilization used a 365 day long year, called Haab, which had 19 months. Each of the first 18 months was 20 days long, and the names of the months were pop, no, zip, zotz, tzec, xul, yoxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, koyab, cumhu. Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called uayet and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Maya believed that this month was unlucky, the court of justice was not in session, the trade stopped, people did not even sweep the floor.For religious purposes, the Maya used another calendar in which the year was called Tzolkin (holly year). The year was divided into thirteen periods, each 20 days long. Each day was denoted by a pair consisting of a number and the name of the day. They used 20 names: imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau and 13 numbers; both in cycles.Notice that each day has an unambiguous description. For example, at the beginning of the year the days were described as follows:1 imix, 2 ik, 3 akbal, 4 kan, 5 chicchan, 6 cimi, 7 manik, 8 lamat, 9 muluk, 10 ok, 11 chuen, 12 eb, 13 ben, 1 ix, 2 mem, 3 cib, 4 caban, 5 eznab, 6 canac, 7 ahau, and again in the next period 8 imix, 9 ik, 10 akbal . . .Years (both Haab and Tzolkin) were denoted by numbers 0, 1, : : : , where the number 0 was the beginning of the world. Thus, the first day was:Haab: 0. pop 0Tzolkin: 1 imix 0Help professor M. A. Ya and write a program for him to convert the dates from the Haab calendar to the Tzolkin calendar.'
b"IONU Satellite Imaging, Inc. records and stores very large images using run length encoding. You are to write a program that reads a compressed image, finds the edges in the image, as described below, and outputs another compressed image of the detected edges.A simple edge detection algorithm sets an output pixel's value to be the maximum absolute value of the differences between it and all its surrounding pixels in the input image. Consider the input image below:The upper left pixel in the output image is the maximum of the values |15-15|,|15-100|, and |15-100|, which is 85. The pixel in the 4th row, 2nd column is computed as the maximum of |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-175|, |175-25|, |175-175|,|175-175|, and |175-25|, which is 150.Images contain 2 to 1,000,000,000 (109) pixels. All images are encoded using run length encoding (RLE). This is a sequence of pairs, containing pixel value (0-255) and run length (1-109). Input images have at most 1,000 of these pairs. Successive pairs have different pixel values. All lines in an image contain the same number of pixels."
b"Have you done any Philately lately?You have been hired by the Ruritanian Postal Service (RPS) to design their new postage software. The software allocates stamps to customers based on customer needs and the denominations that are currently in stock.Ruritania is filled with people who correspond with stamp collectors. As a service to these people, the RPS asks that all stamp allocations have the maximum number of different types of stamps in it. In fact, the RPS has been known to issue several stamps of the same denomination in order to please customers (these count as different types, even though they are the same denomination). The maximum number of different types of stamps issued at any time is twenty-five.To save money, the RPS would like to issue as few duplicate stamps as possible (given the constraint that they want to issue as many different types). Further, the RPS won't sell more than four stamps at a time."

For those who are not familiar with the original problem: from among n people, numbered 1, 2, . . ., n, standing in circle every mth is going to be executed and only the life of the last remaining person will be saved. Joseph was smart enough to choose the position of the last remaining person, thus saving his life to give us the message about the incident. For example when n = 6 and m = 5 then the people will be executed in the order 5, 4, 6, 2, 3 and 1 will be saved.Suppose that there are k good guys and k bad guys. In the circle the first k are good guys and the last k bad guys. You have to determine such minimal m that all the bad guys will be executed before the first good guy."
b'Sally Jones has a dozen Voyageur silver dollars. However, only eleven of the coins are true silver dollars; one coin is counterfeit even though its color and size make it indistinguishable from the real silver dollars. The counterfeit coin has a different weight from the other coins but Sally does not know if it is heavier or lighter than the real coins.Happily, Sally has a friend who loans her a very accurate balance scale. The friend will permit Sally three weighings to find the counterfeit coin. For instance, if Sally weighs two coins against each other and the scales balance then she knows these two coins are true. Now if Sally weighsone of the true coins against a third coin and the scales do not balance then Sally knows the third coin is counterfeit and she can tell whether it is light or heavy depending on whether the balance on which it is placed goes up or down, respectively.By choosing her weighings carefully, Sally is able to ensure that she will find the counterfeit coin with exactly three weighings.'
b'Marsha and Bill own a collection of marbles. They want to split the collection among themselves so that both receive an equal share of the marbles. This would be easy if all the marbles had the same value, because then they could just split the collection in half. But unfortunately, some of the marbles are larger, or more beautiful than others. So, Marsha and Bill start by assigning a value, a natural number between one and six, to each marble. Now they want to divide the marbles so that each of them gets the same total value. Unfortunately, they realize that it might be impossible to divide the marbles in this way (even if the total value of all marbles is even). For example, if there are one marble of value 1, one of value 3 and two of value 4, then they cannot be split into sets of equal value. So, they ask you to write a program that checks whether there is a fair partition of the marbles.'

It is called self-inventorying after j steps (j>=1) if j is the smallest number such that the value of the j-th iterative application of the inventory function is self-inventorying.

b'The 2D-Nim board game is played on a grid, with pieces on the grid points. On each move, a player may remove any positive number of contiguous pieces in any row or column. The player who removes the last piece wins. For example, consider the left grid in the following figure.The player on move may remove (A), (B), (A, B), (A, B, C), or (B,F), etc., but may not remove (A, C), (D, E), (H, I) or (B, G).For purposes of writing 2D-Nim-playing software, a certain programmer wants to be able to tell whether or not a certain position has ever been analyzed previously. Because of the rules of 2D-Nim, it should be clear that the two boards above are essentially equivalent. That is, if there is a winning strategy for the left board, the same one must apply to the right board. The fact that the contiguous groups of pieces appear in different places and orientations is clearly irrelevant. All that matters is that the same clusters of pieces (a cluster being a set of contiguous pieces that can be reached from each other by a sequence of one-square vertical or horizontal moves) appear in each. For example, the cluster of pieces (A, B, C, F, G) appears on both boards, but it has been reflected (swapping left and right), rotated, and moved. Your task is to determine whether two given board states are equivalent in this sense or not.'
b"We usually think that there are three geometric dimensions; the fourth dimension is usually time. However, the Association for Customizing Machines (ACM) has to deal with four geometrical dimensions for their strange customer EE3 who needs to pack four dimensional products into perpendicular parallelepipeds before shipping them to the newly emerged market niche just on the outskirts of the Milky Way.Each of EE3 products consists of a number of unit 4D cubes that are glued together at their faces. A face of a 4D cube is a 3D cube and each 4D cube has 8 such faces. The picture on the left shows a 4D cube projected into a plane with the four principal, orthogonal axes shown. It takes a bit of effort to stretch our imagination and see the faces of a 4D cube in such a projection. The pictures below try to illustrate how the two faces along each of the four axes are situated in 4D. Again, using just the planar projection it is not so easy to illustrate and takes some effort to see. But we have done a good job, didn't we?Each EE3 product to be packed consists of a number of unit 4D cubes that are glued together along their faces which are 3D cubes. Your job is simple: find the minimal volume measured in the number of unit 4D cubes of a perpendicular parallelepiped (a 4D box) into which the product can be packed before shipping."
b"In a k bit 2's complement number, where the bits are indexed from 0 to k-1, the weight of the most significant bit (i.e., in position k-1), is -2^(k-1), and the weight of a bit in any position i (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < k-1) is 2^i. For example, a 3 bit number 101 is -2^2 + 0 + 2^0 = -3. A negatively weighted bit is called a negabit (such as the most significant bit in a 2's complement number), and a positively weighted bit is called a posibit.A Fun number system is a positional binary number system, where each bit can be either a negabit, or a posibit. For example consider a 3-bit fun number system Fun3, where bits in positions 0, and 2 are posibits, and the bit in position 1 is a negabit. (110)Fun3 is evaluated as 2^2-2^1 + 0 = 3. Now you are going to have fun with the Fun number systems! You are given the description of a k-bit Fun number system Funk, and an integer N (possibly negative. You should determine the k bits of a representation of N in Funk, or report that it is not possible to represent the given N in the given Funk. For example, a representation of -1 in the Fun3 number system (defined above), is 011 (evaluated as 0 - 2^1 + 2^0), andrepresenting 6 in Fun3 is impossible."
b'Tester ProgramFor this contest, we first designed the following problem (note that you do not have to solve it!):Another Wall in the MazeIn ACM/ICPC contests, you\'ll often see questions such as "find the shortest path out of this maze." Let\'s turn this on its head and ask "given a path, find a maze for which the given path is the shortest path." Our paths will run vertically and horizontally between the regularly spaced points of a rectangular grid. The problem is to compute a set of unit-length baffles (walls) separating grid points that forces the given path to be the unique shortest path from its starting point to the end point. To make things more interesting, we will require that there should be no redundant walls constructed in the sense that it should not be possible to remove any wall and still have the given path as the unique shortest path. In the following figure for example, consider the path through the 8 ? 5 grid on the left maze of the top row. The wall placements in the two mazes to its right (top row) make that path unique. The two mazes on the lower row are faulty.The path is not unique in the one on the left, and there are some redundant walls on the right.Input (of the original problem)The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case consists of two integers W and H (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W, H \xe2\x89\xa4 100) giving the width and height of the grid respectively. The second line of the test case contains a path. The path always starts in the lowerleft corner, (0, 0). It is specified as a string of U (up), D (down), L (left), and R (right) characters (with no embedded white space). You may assume that the path remains within the bounds of the maze and does not intersect itself. It may end anywhere in the maze (i.e., not necessarily in a corner or against a wall).Output (of the original problem)First line of the output for the i-th test case (starting from one) should contain an integer M, the number of walls used in the solution. Following the first line, there are M lines each containing a wall specification in the form of four consecutive integers corresponding to two pairs of (x, y) coordinates specifying adjacent grid points separated by the wall (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x < W and 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 y < H). Note that the possible output is not unique. There should no blank line in the output.Sample Input (of the original problem)28 5RRRUULLURRRRDDRRUUU4 3RRRUUSample Output (of the original problem)190 0 0 11 0 1 12 0 2 12 1 3 13 0 4 03 1 4 13 2 4 23 2 3 32 2 2 34 2 4 30 3 0 41 3 1 42 3 2 43 3 3 44 3 4 45 3 5 45 3 6 35 2 6 26 1 6 222 2 3 22 2 2 1This is the end of the original problem statement!

b"The Department of Security has a new headquarters building. The building has several floors, and on each floor there are rooms numbered xxyy where yy stands for the room number and xx for the floor number, 0 < xx; yy <= 10. The building has `pater-noster' elevator, i.e. elevator build up from several cabins running all around. From time to time the agents must visit the headquarters. During their visit they want to visit several rooms and in each room they want to stay for some time. Due to the security reasons, there can be only one agent in the same room at the same time, The same rule applies to the elevators. The visits are planned in the way ensuring they can be accomplished within one day. Each agent visits the headquarters at most once a day.Each agent enters the building at the 1st floor, passes the reception and then starts to visit the rooms according to his/her list. Agents always visit the rooms by the increasing room numbers. The agents form a linear hierarchy according to which they have assigned their one letter personal codes. The agents with higher seniority have lexicographically smaller codes. No two agents have the same code.If more then one agent want to enter a room, or an elevator, the agents have to form a queue. In each queue, they always stand according to their codes. The higher the seniority of the agent, the closer to the top of the queue he stands. Every 5 s (seconds) the first agent in the queue in front of the elevator enters the elevator. After visiting the last room in the headquarters each agent uses if necessary elevator to the first floor and exits the building.The times necessary to move from a certain point in the headquarters to another are set as follows: Entering the building, i.e. passing the reception and reaching the elevator, or a room on the first floor takes 30 s. Exiting the building, i.e. stepping out of the elevator or a room on the first floor and passing the reception takes also 30 s. On the same floor, the transfer from the elevator to the room (or to the queue in front of the room), or from the room to the elevator (or to the queue in front of the elevator), or from one room to another (or to the queue in front of the room) takes 10 s. The transfer from one floor to the next floor above or below in an elevator takes 30 s. Write a program that determines time course of agent's visits in the headquarters."
b'Bob and Alice started to use a brand-new encoding scheme. Surprisingly it is not a Public Key Cryptosystem, but their encoding and decoding is based on secret keys. They chose the secret key at their last meeting in Philadelphia on February 16th, 1996. They chose as a secret key a sequence of n distinct integers, a1 ; . . .; an, greater than zero and less or equal to n. The encoding is based on the following principle. The message is written down below the key, so that characters in the message and numbers in the key are correspondingly aligned. Character in the message at the position i is written in the encoded message at the position ai, where ai is the corresponding number in the key. And then the encoded message is encoded in the same way. This process is repeated k times. After kth encoding they exchange their message.The length of the message is always less or equal than n. If the message is shorter than n, then spaces are added to the end of the message to get the message with the length n.Help Alice and Bob and write program which reads the key and then a sequence of pairs consisting of k and message to be encoded k times and produces a list of encoded messages.'
b'The game named "Same" is a single person game played on a 10 \\Theta 15 board. Each square contains a ball colored red (R), green (G), or blue (B). Two balls belong to the same cluster if they have the same color, and one can be reached from another by following balls of the same color in the four directions up, down, left, and right. At each step of the game, the player chooses a ball whose cluster has at least two balls and removes all balls in the cluster from the board. Then, the board is "compressed" in two steps:1. Shift the remaining balls in each column down to fill the empty spaces. The order of the balls in each column is preserved.2. If a column becomes empty, shift the remaining columns to the left as far as possible. The order of the columns is preserved.For example, choosing the ball at the bottom left corner in the sub-board below causes:The objective of the game is to remove every ball from the board, and the game is over when every ball is removed or when every cluster has only one ball. The scoring of each game is as follows. The player starts with a score of 0. When a cluster of m balls is removed, the player\'s score increases by (m-2)^2 . A bonus of 1000 is given if every ball is removed at the end of the game.You suspect that a good strategy might be to choose the ball that gives the largest possible cluster at each step, and you want to test this strategy by writing a program to simulate games played using this strategy. If there are two or more balls to choose from, the program should choose the leftmost ball giving the largest cluster. If there is still a tie, it should choose the bottommost ball of these leftmost balls.'
b'Standard web browsers contain features to move backward and forward among the pages recently visited. One way to implement these features is to use two stacks to keep track of the pages that can be reached by moving backward and forward. In this problem, you are asked to implement this.The following commands need to be supported:BACK: Push the current page on the top of the forward stack. Pop the page from the top of the backward stack, making it the new current page. If the backward stack is empty, the command is ignored.FORWARD: Push the current page on the top of the backward stack. Pop the page from the top of the forward stack, making it the new current page. If the forward stack is empty, the command is ignored.VISIT : Push the current page on the top of the backward stack, and make the URL specified the new current page. The forward stack is emptied.QUIT: Quit the browser.Assume that the browser initially loads the web page at the URL http://www.acm.org/'
b'The "Gold Bar"bank received information from reliable sources that in their last group of N coins exactly one coin is false and differs in weight from other coins (while all other coins are equal in weight). After the economic crisis they have only a simple balance available (like one in the picture). Using this balance, one is able to determine if the weight of objects in the left pan is less than, greater than, or equal to the weight of objects in the right pan.In order to detect the false coin the bank employees numbered all coins by the integers from 1 to N, thus assigning each coin a unique integer identifier. After that they began to weight various groups of coins by placing equal numbers of coins in the left pan and in the right pan. The identifiers of coins and the results of the weightings were carefully recorded.You are to write a program that will help the bank employees to determine the identifier of the false coin using the results of these weightings.'
b"One of the participants of both regional contests which took place in St. Petersburg decided to determine overall rating for all teams that took part in at least one contest.This participant assigned each team a unique team identifier, which was an integer from 1 to 100 inclusively. For each contest team identifiers of the participating teams were written in a column according to their place in that contest. Identifiers of the teams that had equal results were written on the same line. The participant started with the team(s) that was(were) the best in that contest (writing them on the first line) and continued in the order of decreasing results.Definition: Let's say that the team has place K in the contest if exactly K-1 teams performed in that contest better.Consider the following examples of two contests' results:Contest no. 1Contest no. 2placeteam's idplaceteam's id191327 1 4255531 10615 856831 1869101771984 201021The overall rating for the teams which took part in both contests is defined in the following way:1) If some team performed better in both contests than some other team (or better in one contest and with the same result in the other contest) then the overall rating of the former team is higher than the rating of the latter team.2) If one of the teams in question performed better in one contest and the other team performed better in another contest then their overall rating depends on the difference of their places in both contests. So, in our example team 1 is better than team 5 in the first contest with a difference of 3 places and worse in the second contest with a difference of only 1 place, therefore the overall rating of team 1 is higher than team 5's one. If the difference of the places is the same for both contests then that teams have the equal overall ratings. The latter is also true for the teams that performed equally in both contests.In our example only teams 1, 4, 5, and 9 participated twice. Team 1 has the highest rating, teams 5 and 9 with the equal rating follow, and team 4 has the lowest rating.For the teams that participated in one contest only the overall rating and their position in the resulting list cannot be always determined. They are included in the overall list (where the teams which participated twice already placed according to the rules above) if one of the following takes place:A) If there is a team that participated in both contests and shared the place in one of the contests with the team in question then the latter team shares the overall rating with this team too (if there is more than one such team, then they all should have the same overall rating, otherwise the overall rating of the team in question cannot be determined).B) If there is a position in the overall list (either at the beginning of the list, at the end of the list, or between some lines), such that before this position only the teams are located which performed better in the same contest as the team in question and after this position only the teams are located which performed worse in the same contest as the team in question, then the team in question occupies this position in the overall list. If more than one team claim to have the same position in the overall list, then their mutual order is defined by their places in their contests (look at the example below for details).Teams that participated in both contestsTeams that participated in one contest only31109 51942015 831 1817 21?Team 3 will occupy the first place in the overall list (rule B).?The positions of teams 6 and 7 cannot be determined.?Team 10 will share the overall rating with team 1 (rule A).?Team 20 will share the overall rating with team 4 (rule A).?Team 19 will occupy the position between teams 9, 5 and team 4 (rule B).?Teams 8, 15, 17, 18, 21, and 31 will finish the overall list (rule B). But the first of them will be teams 15 and 8 (that took 6th place) followed by teams 31 and 18 (that took 8th place) and teams 17 and 21 (that took 10th place).Your task is to write a program that will create the overall rating list using the result tables of two contests and the given rules."
b'There is an area bounded by a fence on some flat field. The fence has the height h and in the plane projection it has a form of a closed polygonal line (without self-intersections), which is specified by Cartesian coordinates (Xi, Yi) of its N vertices. At the point with coordinates (0, 0) a lamp stands on the field. The lamp may be located either outside or inside the fence, but not on its side as it is shown in the following sample pictures (parts shown in a thin line are not illuminated by the lamp):The fence is perfectly black, i.e. it is neither reflecting, nor diffusing, nor letting the light through. Research and experiments showed that the following law expresses the intensity of light falling on an arbitrary illuminated point of this fence:I0=k/rwhere k is a known constant value not depending on the point in question, r is the distance between this point and the lamp in the plane projection. The illumination of an infinitesimal narrow vertical board with the width dl and the height h isdI=I0*|cos\xce\xb1|*dl*hwhere I0 is the intensity of light on that board of the fence, \xce\xb1 is the angle in the plane projection between the normal to the side of the fence at this point and the direction to the lamp.You are to write a program that will find the total illumination of the fence that is defined as the sum of illuminations of all its illuminated boards.'
b"New convocation of The Fool Land's Parliament consists of N delegates. According to the present regulation delegates should be divided into disjoint groups of different sizes and every day each group has to send one delegate to the conciliatory committee. The composition of the conciliatory committee should be different each day. The Parliament works only while this can be accomplished.You are to write a program that will determine how many delegates should contain each group in order for Parliament to work as long as possible."
b'You are taking part in the development of a "New Generation" operating system and the NG file system. In this file system all disk space is divided into N clusters of the equal sizes, numbered by integers from 1 to N. Each file occupies one or more clusters in arbitrary areas of the disk. All clusters that are not occupied by files are considered to be free. A file can be read from the disk in the fastest way, if all its clusters are situated in the successive disk clusters in the natural order.Rotation of the disk with constant speed implies that various amounts of time are needed for accessing its clusters. Therefore, reading of clusters located near the beginning of the disk performs faster than reading of the ones located near its ending. Thus, all files are numbered beforehand by integers from 1 to K in the order of descending frequency of access. Under the optimal placing of the files on the disk the file number 1 will occupy clusters 1, 2, ..., S1, the file number 2 will occupy clusters S1+1, S1+2, ..., S1+S2 and so on (here Si is the number of clusters which the i-th file occupies).In order to place the files on the disk in the optimal way cluster-moving operations are executed. One cluster-moving operation includes reading of one occupied cluster from the disk to the memory and writing its contents to some free cluster. After that the first of them is declared free, and the second one is declared occupied.Your goal is to place the files on the disk in the optimal way by executing the minimal possible number of cluster-moving operations.'
b"Hunter Bob often walks with his dog Ralph. Bob walks with a constant speed and his route is a polygonal line (possibly self-intersecting) whose vertices are specified by N pairs of integers (Xi, Yi) ? their Cartesian coordinates.Ralph walks on his own way but always meets his master at the specified N points. The dog starts his journey simultaneously with Bob at the point (X1, Y1) and finishes it also simultaneously with Bob at the point (XN, YN).Ralph can travel at a speed that is up to two times greater than his master's speed. While Bob travels in a straight line from one point to another the cheerful dog seeks trees, bushes, hummocks and all other kinds of interesting places of the local landscape which are specified by M pairs of integers (Xj',Yj'). However, after leaving his master at the point (Xi, Yi) (where 1 <= i < N) the dog visits at most one interesting place before meeting his master again at the point (Xi+1, Yi+1).Your task is to find the dog's route, which meets the above requirements and allows him to visit the maximal possible number of interesting places. The answer should be presented as a polygonal line that represents Ralph's route. The vertices of this route should be all points (Xi, Yi) and the maximal number of interesting places (Xj',Yj'). The latter should be visited (i.e. listed in the route description) at most once.An example of Bob's route (solid line), a set of interesting places (dots) and one of the best Ralph's routes (dotted line) are presented in the following picture:"

b'N gangsters are going to a restaurant. The i-th gangster comes at the time Ti and has the prosperity Pi. The door of the restaurant has K+1 states of openness expressed by the integers in the range [0, K]. The state of openness can change by one in one unit of time; i.e. it either opens by one, closes by one or remains the same. At the initial moment of time the door is closed (state 0). The i-th gangster enters the restaurant only if the door is opened specially for him, i.e. when the state of openness coincides with his stoutness Si. If at the moment of time when the gangster comes to the restaurant the state of openness is not equal to his stoutness, then the gangster goes away and never returns.The restaurant works in the interval of time [0, T].The goal is to gather the gangsters with the maximal total prosperity in the restaurant by opening and closing the door appropriately.'
b'Richard just finished building his new house. Now the only thing the house misses is a cute little wooden fence. He had no idea how to make a wooden fence, so he decided to order one. Somehow he got his hands on the ACME Fence Catalogue 2002, the ultimate resource on cute little wooden fences. After reading its preface he already knew, what makes a little wooden fence cute.A wooden fence consists of N wooden planks, placed vertically in a row next to each other. A fence looks cute if and only if the following conditions are met:\xef\xbf\xbdThe planks have different lengths, namely 1, 2, . . . , N plank length units.\xef\xbf\xbdEach plank with two neighbors is either larger than each of its neighbors or smaller than each of them. (Note that this makes the top of the fence alternately rise and fall.)It follows, that we may uniquely describe each cute fence with N planks as a permutation a1, . . . , aN of the numbers 1, . . . ,N such that (any i; 1 < i < N) (ai \xe2\x88\x92 ai\xe2\x88\x921)*(ai \xe2\x88\x92 ai+1) > 0 and vice versa, each such permutation describes a cute fence.It is obvious, that there are many di erent cute wooden fences made of N planks. To bring some order into their catalogue, the sales manager of ACME decided to order them in the following way: Fence A (represented by the permutation a1, . . . , aN) is in the catalogue before fence B (represented by b1, . . . , bN) if and only if there exists such i, that (any j < i) aj = bj and (ai < bi). (Also to decide, which of the two fences is earlier in the catalogue, take their corresponding permutations, find the first place on which they differ and compare the values on this place.) All the cute fences with N planks are numbered (starting from 1) in the order they appear in the catalogue. This number is called their catalogue number.After carefully examining all the cute little wooden fences, Richard decided to order some of them. For each of them he noted the number of its planks and its catalogue number. Later, as he met his friends, he wanted to show them the fences he ordered, but he lost the catalogue somewhere. The only thing he has got are his notes. Please help him find out, how will his fences look like.'
b'Bugs Integrated, Inc. is a major manufacturer of advanced memory chips. They are launching production of a new six terabyte Q-RAM chip. Each chip consists of six unit squares arranged in a form of a 2*3 rectangle. The way Q-RAM chips are made is such that one takes a rectangular plate of silicon divided into N*M unit squares. Then all squares are tested carefully and the bad ones are marked with a black marker.Finally, the plate of silicon is cut into memory chips. Each chip consists of 2*3 (or 3*2) unit squares. Of course, no chip can contain any bad (marked) squares. It might not be possible to cut the plate so that every good unit square is a part of some memory chip. The corporation wants to waste as little good squares as possible. Therefore they would like to know how to cut the plate to make the maximum number of chips possible.TaskYou are given the dimensions of several silicon plates and a list of all bad unit squares for each plate. Your task is to write a program that computes for each plate the maximum number of chips that can be cut out of the plate.'
b'The GX Light Pipeline Company started to prepare bent pipes for the new transgalactic light pipeline. During the design phase of the new pipe shape the company ran into the problem of determining how far the light can reach inside each component of the pipe. Note that the material which the pipe is made from is not transparent and not light reflecting.Each pipe component consists of many straight pipes connected tightly together. For the programming purposes, the company developed the description of each component as a sequence of points [x1; y1], [x2; y2], . . ., [xn; yn], where x1 < x2 < . . . xn . These are the upper points of the pipe contour. The bottom points of the pipe contour consist of points with y-coordinate decreased by 1. To each upper point [xi; yi] there is a corresponding bottom point [xi; (yi)-1] (see picture above). The company wants to find, for each pipe component, the point with maximal x-coordinate that the light will reach. The light is emitted by a segment source with endpoints [x1; (y1)-1] and [x1; y1] (endpoints are emitting light too). Assume that the light is not bent at the pipe bent points and the bent points do not stop the light beam.'
b'Ruratania is just entering capitalism and is establishing new enterprising activities in many fields in- cluding transport. The transportation company TransRuratania is starting a new express train from city A to city B with several stops in the stations on the way. The stations are successively numbered, city A station has number 0, city B station number m. The company runs an experiment in order to improve passenger transportation capacity and thus to increase its earnings. The train has a maximum capacity n passengers. The price of the train ticket is equal to the number of stops (stations) between the starting station and the destination station (including the destination station). Before the train starts its route from the city A, ticket orders are collected from all onroute stations. The ticket order from the station S means all reservations of tickets from S to a fixed destination station. In case the company cannot accept all orders because of the passenger capacity limitations, its rejection policy is that it either completely accept or completely reject single orders from single stations.Write a program which for the given list of orders from single stations on the way from A to B determines the biggest possible total earning of the TransRuratania company. The earning from one accepted order is the product of the number of passengers included in the order and the price of their train tickets. The total earning is the sum of the earnings from all accepted orders.'
b"Little Johnny has got a new car. He decided to drive around the town to visit his friends. Johnny wanted to visit all his friends, but there was many of them. In each street he had one friend. He started thinking how to make his trip as short as possible. Very soon he realized that the best way to do it was to travel through each street of town only once. Naturally, he wanted to finish his trip at the same place he started, at his parents' house.The streets in Johnny's town were named by integer numbers from 1 to n, n < 1995. The junctions were independently named by integer numbers from 1 to m, m <= 44. No junction connects more than 44 streets. All junctions in the town had different numbers. Each street was connecting exactly two junctions. No two streets in the town had the same number. He immediately started to plan his round trip. If there was more than one such round trip, he would have chosen the one which, when written down as a sequence of street numbers is lexicographically the smallest. But Johnny was not able to find even one such round trip.Help Johnny and write a program which finds the desired shortest round trip. If the round trip does not exist the program should write a message. Assume that Johnny lives at the junction ending the street appears first in the input with smaller number. All streets in the town are two way. There exists a way from each street to another street in the town. The streets in the town are very narrow and there is no possibility to turn back the car once he is in the street"
b'John is going on a fishing trip. He has h hours available (1 <= h <= 16), and there are n lakes in the area (2 <= n <= 25) all reachable along a single, one-way road. John starts at lake 1, but he can finish at any lake he wants. He can only travel from one lake to the next one, but he does not have to stop at any lake unless he wishes to. For each i = 1,...,n - 1, the number of 5-minute intervals it takes to travel from lake i to lake i + 1 is denoted ti (0 < ti <=192). For example, t3 = 4 means that it takes 20 minutes to travel from lake 3 to lake 4. To help plan his fishing trip, John has gathered some information about the lakes. For each lake i, the number of fish expected to be caught in the initial 5 minutes, denoted fi( fi >= 0 ), is known. Each 5 minutes of fishing decreases the number of fish expected to be caught in the next 5-minute interval by a constant rate of di (di >= 0). If the number of fish expected to be caught in an interval is less than or equal to di , there will be no more fish left in the lake in the next interval. To simplify the planning, John assumes that no one else will be fishing at the lakes to affect the number of fish he expects to catch.Write a program to help John plan his fishing trip to maximize the number of fish expected to be caught. The number of minutes spent at each lake must be a multiple of 5.'
b"The FBI is conducting a surveillance of a known criminal hideout which serves as a communication center for a number of men and women of nefarious intent. Using sophisticated decryption software and good old fashion wiretaps, they are able to decode any e-mail messages leaving the site. However, before any arrest warrants can be served, they must match actual names with the user ID's on the messages. While these criminals are evil, they're not stupid, so they use random strings of letters fortheir ID's (no dillingerj ID's found here). The FBI knows that each criminal uses only one ID. The only other information they have which will help them is a log of names of the people who enter and leave the hideout. In many cases, this is enough to link the names to the ID's."
b"There are rumors that there are a lot of computers having a problem with the year 2000. As they use only two digits to represent the year, the date will suddenly turn from 1999 to 1900. In fact, there are also many other, similar problems. On some systems, a 32-bit integer is used to store the number of seconds that have elapsed since a certain fixed date. In thisway, when 2^32 seconds (about 136 Years) have elapsed, the date will jump back to whatever the fixed date is.Now, what can you do about all that mess? Imagine you have two computers C1 and C with two different bugs: One with the ordinary Y2K-Bug (i. e. switching to a1 := 1900 instead of b1 := 2000) and one switching to a2 := 1904 instead of b2 := 2040. Imagine that the C1 displays the year y1 := 1941 and C2 the year y2 := 2005. Then you know the following (assuming that there are no other bugs): the real year can't be 1941, since, then, both computers would show the (same) right date. If the year would be 2005, y1 would be 1905, so this is impossible, too. Looking only at C1 , we know that the real year is one of the following: 1941, 2041, 2141, etc. We now can calculate what C2 would display in these years: 1941, 1905, 2005, etc. So in fact, it is possible that the actual year is 2141.To calculate all this manually is a lot of work. (And you don't really want to do it each time you forgot the actual year.) So, your task is to write a program which does the calculation for you: find the first possible real year, knowing what some other computers say (yi) and knowing their bugs (switching to ai instead of bi ). Note that the year ai is definitely not after the year the computer was built. Since the actual year can't be before the year the computers were built, the year your program is looking for can't be before any ai ."
b'Consider the AC circuit below. We will assume that the circuit is in steady-state. Thus, the voltage at nodes 1 and 2 are given by v1 = VS coswt and v2 = VRcos (wt + q ) where VS is the voltage of the source, w is the frequency (in radians per second), and t is time. VR is the magnitude of the voltage drop across the resistor, and q is its phase.You are to write a program to determine VR for different values of w. You will need two laws of electricity to solve this problem. The first is Ohm\'s Law, which states v2 = iR where i is the current in the circuit, oriented clockwise. The second is i = C d/dt (v1-v2) which relates the current to the voltage on either side of the capacitor. "d/dt"indicates the derivative with respect to t.'
b'A color reduction is a mapping from a set of discrete colors to a smaller one. The solution to this problem requires that you perform just such a mapping in a standard twenty-four bit RGB color space. The input consists of a target set of sixteen RGB color values, and a collection of arbitrary RGB colors to be mapped to their closest color in the target set. For our purposes, an RGB color is defined as an ordered triple (R,G,B) where each value of the triple is an integer from 0 to 255. The distance between two colors is defined as the Euclidean distance between two three-dimensional points.

b'A cyclic number is an integer n digits in length which, when multiplied by any integer from 1 to n, yields a"cycle"of the digits of the original number. That is, if you consider the number after the last digit to "wrap around"back to the first digit, the sequence of digits in both numbers will be the same, though they may start at different positions.For example, the number 142857 is cyclic, as illustrated by the following table:142857 *1 = 142857142857 *2 = 285714142857 *3 = 428571142857 *4 = 571428142857 *5 = 714285142857 *6 = 857142'
b'For this problem you will determine the output of a logic circuit composed of one or more inputs, zero or more dual-input AND/OR gates, and one output. The input circuits are drawn with standard ASCII characters. Circuit paths are represented using horizontal and vertical lines, and junctions. Horizontal lines are represented with dash characters (ASCII code 45 decimal), vertical lines with vertical bar characters (ASCII code 124 decimal), and junctions with plus characters (ASCII code 43 decimal). Inputs are represented using the capital letters A through Z, and the output is represented by a question mark. AND and OR gates are represented as shown in the leftmost entries in the figure below, and their orientation will always be exactly as shown. The location of the gate inputs and output is shown by the middle figure below. Finally, gate inputs or its output can be inverted, represented by a lowercase "oh"character (ASCII code 111 decimal) at the input or output location. The figure on the right below shows a simple but complete logic circuit.        :\\               :\\                 -:\\                 -o:\\                       A-o:\\        : )              : >                 : )-                 : )o-                       : )o-?        :/               :/                 -:/                 --:/                       B--:/     AND gate          OR gate       Gate with inputs    An inverted top input          Two logic inputs                                                  and an inverted output         and the output'
b'Consider a small microprocessor that has the following properties:?Each word is four bits.?Addresses are two words. The high word always comes first. That is, the high word of a two-word address will always occupy the lower word of memory.?Memory is 256 words.?There are two accumulators, A and B, each storing one word.?There are nine instruction codes. Each instruction requires at least one word to store the code that specifies the instruction. Four instructions have arguments and require an additional two words.Each 4 bit number can have the values from 0 to 15, inclusive, in base 10. We will write these using hexadecimal in the usual way, i.e. A means 10, B means 11, etc.These are the nine instructions:Code Words Description0 3 LD: Load accumulator A with the contents of memory at the specified argument.1 3 ST: Write the contents of accumulator A to the memory location specified by the argumen2 1 SWP: Swap the contents of accumulators A and B.3 1 ADD: Add the contents of accumulators A and B. The low word of the sum is stored in A, and the high word in B4 1 INC: Increment accumulator A. Overflow is allowed; that is, incrementing F yields 0.5 1 DEC: Decrement accumulator A. Underflow is allowed; that is, decrementing 0 yields F.6 3 BZ: If accumulator A is zero, the next command to be executed is at the location specified by the argument. If A is not zero, the argument is ignored and nothing happens.7 3 BR: The next command to be executed is at the location specified by the argument.8 1 STP: Stop execution of the program.The microprocessor always begins by executing the command at location 00. It executes the commands in sequence until it reaches the Stop command.The examples below show partial programs and describe their affect.Program Description01A8 Load accumulator A with the contents of memory location 1A (26 in decimal) and stop.01A512F8 Load accumulator A with the contents of memory location 1A (26 in decimal), decrement it, store the result to memory location 2F, then stop.'
b'Given a two-dimensional array of positive and negative integers, a sub-rectangle is any contiguous sub-array of size 1*1 or greater located within the whole array. The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. In this problem the sub-rectangle with the largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle.As an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array:0 -2 -7 09 2 -6 2-4 1 -4 1-1 8 0 -2is in the lower left corner:9 2-4 1-1 8and has a sum of 15.'
b'Morse code represents characters as variable length sequences of dots and dashes. In practice, characters in a message are delimited by short pauses. The following table shows the Morse code sequences:A .- H .... O --- V ...-B -... I .. P .--. W .--C -.-. J .--- Q --.- X -..-D -.. K -.- R .-. Y -.--E . L .-.. S ... Z --..F ..-. M -- T -G --. N -. U ..-Note that four dot-dash combinations are unassigned. For the purposes of this problem we will assign them as follows (these are not the assignments for actual Morse code):underscore ..-- period ---.comma .-.- question mark ----Thus, the message "ACM_GREATER_NY_REGION" is encoded as:.- -.-. -- ..-- --. .-. . .- - . .-. ..-- -. -.-- ..-- .-. . --. .. --- -.M.E. Ohaver proposed an encryption scheme based on mutilating Morse code. Her scheme replaces the pauses between letters, necessary because Morse is a variable-length encoding that is not prefix-free, with a string that identifies the number of dots and dashes in each. For example, consider the message ".--.-.--". Without knowing where the pauses should be, this could be "ACM", "ANK", or several other possibilities. If we add length information, however, ".--.-.--242", then the code is unabiguous.Ohaver\'s scheme has three steps, the same for encryption and decryption:1. Convert the text to Morse code without pauses but with a string of numbers to indicate code lengths2. Reverse the string of numbers3. Convert the dots and dashes back into to text using the reversed string of numbers as code lengthsAs an example, consider the encrypted message "AKADTOF_IBOETATUK_IJN". Converting to Morse code with a length string yields ".--.-.--..----..-...--..-...---.-.--..--.-..--...----.232313442431121334242". Reversing the numbers and decoding yields the original message "ACM_GREATER_NY_REGION".'
b'Plato believed what we perceive is but a shadow of reality. Recent archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence that this belief may have been encouraged by Plato\'s youthful amusement with cleverly-designed blocks. The blocks have the curious property that, when held with any face toward a light source, they cast shadows of various letters, numbers, shapes, and patterns. It is possible for three faces incident to a corner to correspond to three different shadow patterns. Opposite faces, of course, cast shadows which are mirror images of one another.The blocks are formed by gluing together small cubes to form a single, connected object. As an example, the figures below show, layer by layer, the internal structure of a block which can cast shadows of the letters "E", "G", or "B".Only a partial set of blocks was discovered, but the curious scientists would like to determine what combinations of shadows are possible. Your program, the solution to this problem, will help them! The program will input groups of shadow patterns, and for each group will report whether or not a solid can be constructed that will cast those three shadows.'
b'The game of Set is played with a deck of eighty-one cards, each having the following four characteristics:. Symbol: diamonds, ovals, or squiggles. Count: 1, 2, or 3 symbols. Color: red, green, or purple. Shading: outlined, filled, or stripedThe cards are shuffled and a tableau of twelve cards is laid out. Players then attempt to be the first to identify "sets" which exist in the tableau. Sets are removed as they are identified and new cards are dealt in their place. Play continues in this manner until all cards have been used. The winner is the player with the most sets.A set is a collection of three cards in which each characteristic is either the same on all three cards or different on all three cards. For example, the cards shown below form a set.To see how the cards above form a set, take each characteristic in turn. First, each card has different symbol: the first card has squiggles, the second diamonds, and the third ovals. Second, each card has the same count of symbols, three. Third each card has a different color, and finally, each card has a different shading. Thus, each characteristic is either the same on all three cards or different on all three cards, satisfying the requirement for a set.Consider the following example of three cards which do not form a set.Again, take each characteristic in turn. Each card has a different symbol, each card has a different count of symbols, and each card is the same color. So far this satisfies the requirements for a set. When the shading characteristic is considered, however, two cards are filled and one card is striped. Thus, the shading on all three cards is neither all the same nor all different, and so these cards do not form a set.'
b'In Korea, the naughtiness of the cheonggaeguri, a small frog, is legendary. This is a well-deserved reputation, because the frogs jump through your rice paddy at night, flattening rice plants. In the morning, after noting which plants have been flattened, you want to identify the path of the frog which did the most damage. A frog always jumps through the paddy in a straight line, with every hop the same length:Your rice paddy has plants arranged on the intersection points of a grid as shown in Figure-1, and the troublesome frogs hop completely through your paddy, starting outside the paddy on one side and ending outside the paddy on the other side as shown in Figure-2:Many frogs can jump through the paddy, hopping from rice plant to rice plant. Every hop lands on a plant and flattens it, as in Figure-3. Note that some plants may be landed on by more than one frog during the night. Of course, you can not see the lines showing the paths of the frogs or any of their hops outside of your paddy ?for the situation in Figure-3, what you can see is shown in Figure-4:From Figure-4, you can reconstruct all the possible paths which the frogs may have followed across your paddy. You are only interested in frogs which have landed on at least 3 of your rice plants in their voyage through the paddy. Such a path is said to be a frog path. In this case, that means that the three paths shown in Figure-3 are frog paths (there are also other possible frog paths). The vertical path down column 1 might have been a frog path with hop length 4 except there are only 2 plants flattened so we are not interested; and the diagonal path including the plants on row 2 col. 3, row 3 col. 4, and row 6 col. 7 has three flat plants but there is no regular hop length which could have spaced the hops in this way while still landing on at least 3 plants, and hence it is not a frog path. Note also that along the line a frog path follows there may be additional flattened plants which do not need to be landed on by that path (see the plant at (2, 6) on the horizontal path across row 2 in Figure-4), and in fact some flattened plants may not be explained by any frog path at all.Your task is to write a program to determine the maximum number of landings in any single frog path (where the maximum is taken over all possible frog paths). In Figure-4 the answer is 7, obtained from the frog path across row 6.'
b'An organization that wishes to make a large mailing can save postage by following U.S. Postal Service rules for a bulk mailing. Letters in zip code order are bundled into packets of 10-15 letters each. Bundles may consist of letters in which all 5 digits of zip code are the same (5-digit bundles), or they may consist of letters in which only the first 3 digits of zip code are the same (3-digit bundles). If there are fewer than 10 letters to make up a bundle of either type, those letters are mailed first class.'
b'An encoding of a set of symbols is said to be immediately decodable if no code for one symbol is the prefix of a code for another symbol. We will assume for this problem that all codes are in binary, that no two codes within a set of codes are the same, that each code has at least one bit and no more than ten bits, and that each set has at least two codes and no more than eight.Examples: Assume an alphabet that has symbols {A, B, C, D}The following code is immediately decodable:A:01 B:10 C:0010 D:0000but this one is not:A:01 B:10 C:010 D:0000 (Note that A is a prefix of C)'
b'It is often helpful for computer users to see a visual representation of the file structure on their computers. The "explorer" in Microsoft Windows is an example of such a system. Before the days of graphical user interfaces, however, such visual representations were not possible. The best that could be done was to show a static "map"of directories and files, using indentation as a guide to directory contents. For example:ROOT| DIR1|        File1| File2| File3| DIR2| DIR3| File1File1File2This shows that the root directory contains two files and three subdirectories. The first subdirectory contains 3 files, the second is empty and the third contains one file.'
b"The gourmet club of ACM City has 16 members. They contracted the proprietor of the local French restaurant Chateau Java to arrange dinner parties for 5 consecutive evenings. They asked to be seated around 4 tables, 4 persons per table. They also stipulated that during the 5 evenings, every member of the club will share a table exactly once with each member of the club. Mr. I.B. Emm, the restaurateur, assigned his Maitre D' the task of scheduling the seating for the 5 evenings. On the first evening, the Maitre D' seated the members as they arrived and recorded their seating. Each subsequent evening, he carefully planned the seating to match the requirement that no member will be dining twice with some other member. Unfortunately, the Maitre D' disappeared on the morning of the fourth evening. Mr. Emm was left only with his notes which included the recorded seating arrangements during the previous 3 evenings. As he was trying to schedule the seating for the remaining evenings, it dawned on him that this task may not be that easy. He is asking for your help to try and see whether the remaining two evenings can be scheduled. The following is a sample of the Maitre D's seating arrangements during the first 3 evenings:ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOPAEIM BFJN CGKO DHLPAFKP BGLM CHIN DEJOThe members of the gourmet club were identified by the letters A,B,C,...,P.Each line represents one evening of seating with each set of four letters a single table. Thus on the first evening A dines with B, C and D etc. Write a program that will read from the input the seating arrangement of the first three evenings and will either complete the schedule or determine that the Maitre D' screwed up."
b'A popular board game for children is called "Chutes and Ladders". The board has squares which are numbered from 1 to 100, and players have counters which start on the theoretical square 0. The players take turns at throwing a die with the numbers 1 to 6 on it, and each moves his or her counter forward the number of squares corresponding to the number on the die (the square they reach is found by adding the die number to the square number their counter is on). The first person to reach square 100 is the winner.The interest is caused by the fact that pairs of squares are connected together by "ladders" (which connect a lower-numbered square to a higher-numbered square) and "chutes" (which run from high to low). If a counter lands on the start of a chute or ladder (i.e., this is the square reached after throwing the die), then the counter is moved to the corresponding square at the end of the chute or ladder. Note that landing on the end square of a ladder or a chute has no effect, only the start square counts. Furthermore, there are some squares such that if a player\'s counter lands on them, then the player must either miss the next turn, or immediately throw the die again for another turn, depending on what is written on the board. A miss-a-turn or extra-turn square is never the start or end of a ladder or chute. If a player is on square 95 or higher, then a die throw which takes them past 100 must be ignored - thus a player on square 99 must ignore all throws which are not 1.'
b"Consider polynomials whose coefficients are 0 and 1. Addition of two polynomials is achieved by 'adding' the coefficients for the corresponding powers in the polynomials. The addition of coefficients is performed by addition modulo 2, i.e., (0 + 0) mod 2 = 0, (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1, (1 + 0) mod 2 = 1, and (1 + 1) mod 2 = 0. Hence, it is the same as the exclusive-or operation.(x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) + (x^7 + x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2Subtraction of two polynomials is done similarly. Since subtraction of coefficients is performed by subtraction modulo 2 which is also the exclusive-or operation, subtraction of polynomials is identical to addition of polynomials.(x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) - (x^7 + x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2Multiplication of two polynomials is done in the usual way (of course, addition of coefficients is performed by addition modulo 2).(x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) (x^7 + x + 1) = x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1Multiplication of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) modulo a polynomial h(x) is the remainder of f(x)g(x) divided by h(x).(x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) (x^7 + x + 1) modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + 1The largest exponent of a polynomial is called its degree. For example, the degree of x^7 + x^6 + 1 is 7.Given three polynomials f(x), g(x), and h(x), you are to write a program that computes f(x)g(x) modulo h(x).We assume that the degrees of both f(x) and g(x) are less than the degree of h(x). The degree of a polynomial is less than 1000.Since coefficients of a polynomial are 0 or 1, a polynomial can be represented by d+1 and a bit string of length d+1, where d is the degree of the polynomial and the bit string represents the coefficients of the polynomial. For example, x^7 + x^6 + 1 can be represented by 8 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1."

b'This puzzle consists of a random sequence of m black disks and n white disks on an oval-shaped track, with a turnstile capable of flipping (i.e., reversing) three consecutive disks. In Figure 1, there are 8 black disks and 10 white disks on the track. You may spin the turnstile to flip the three disks in it or shift one position clockwise for each of the disks on the track (Figure 1).The goal of this puzzle is to gather the disks of the same color in adjacent positions using flips and shifts. (Figure 2)You are to write a program which decides whether a given sequence can reach a goal or not. If a goal is reachable, then write a message "YES"; otherwise, write a message "NO".'
b'Inhabitants of the Wonderland have decided to hold a regional programming contest. The Judging Committee has volunteered and has promised to organize the most honest contest ever. It was decided to connect computers for the contestants using a "star" topology - i.e. connect them all to a single central hub. To organize a truly honest contest, the Head of the Judging Committee has decreed to place all contestants evenly around the hub on an equal distance from it.To buy network cables, the Judging Committee has contacted a local network solutions provider with a request to sell for them a specified number of cables with equal lengths. The Judging Committee wants the cables to be as long as possible to sit contestants as far from each other as possible.The Cable Master of the company was assigned to the task. He knows the length of each cable in the stock up to a centimeter,and he can cut them with a centimeter precision being told the length of the pieces he must cut. However, this time, the length is not known and the Cable Master is completely puzzled.You are to help the Cable Master, by writing a program that will determine the maximal possible length of a cable piece that can be cut from the cables in the stock, to get the specified number of pieces.'
b"There is a pile of n wooden sticks. The length and weight of each stick are known in advance. The sticks are to be processed by a woodworking machine in one by one fashion. It needs some time, called setup time, for the machine to prepare processing a stick. The setup times are associated with cleaning operations and changing tools and shapes in the machine. The setup times of the woodworking machine are given as follows:(a) The setup time for the first wooden stick is 1 minute.(b) Right after processing a stick of length l and weight w , the machine will need no setup time for a stick of length l' and weight w' if l <= l' and w <= w'. Otherwise, it will need 1 minute for setup.You are to find the minimum setup time to process a given pile of n wooden sticks. For example, if you have five sticks whose pairs of length and weight are ( 9 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 5 , 3 ) , and ( 4 , 1 ) , then the minimum setup time should be 2 minutes since there is a sequence of pairs ( 4 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 3 ) , ( 9 , 4 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) ."
b'Archeologists from the Antiquities and Curios Museum (ACM) have flown to Egypt to examine the great pyramid of Key-Ops. Using state-of-the-art technology they are able to determine that the lower floor of the pyramid is constructed from a series of straightline walls, which intersect to form numerous enclosed chambers. Currently, no doors exist to allow access to any chamber. This state-of-the-art technology has also pinpointed the location of the treasure room. What these dedicated (and greedy) archeologists want to do is blast doors through the walls to get to the treasure room. However, to minimize the damage to the artwork in the intervening chambers (and stay under their government grant for dynamite) they want to blast through the minimum number of doors. For structural integrity purposes, doors should only be blasted at the midpoint of the wall of the room being entered. You are to write a program which determines this minimum number of doors.An example is shown below:'

b'Problems involving the computation of exact values of very large magnitude and precision are common. For example, the computation of the national debt is a taxing experience for many computer systems.This problem requires that you write a program to compute the exact value of Rn where R is a real number ( 0.0 < R < 99.999 ) and n is an integer such that 0 < n <= 25.'
b"Businesses like to have memorable telephone numbers. One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase. For example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable TUT-GLOP. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing 310-GINO. Another way to make a telephone number memorable is to group the digits in a memorable way. You could order your pizza from Pizza Hut by calling their ``three tens'' number 3-10-10-10.The standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits with a hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. 888-1200). The keypad of a phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:A, B, and C map to 2D, E, and F map to 3G, H, and I map to 4J, K, and L map to 5M, N, and O map to 6P, R, and S map to 7T, U, and V map to 8W, X, and Y map to 9There is no mapping for Q or Z. Hyphens are not dialed, and can be added and removed as necessary. The standard form of TUT-GLOP is 888-4567, the standard form of 310-GINO is 310-4466, and the standard form of 3-10-10-10 is 310-1010.Two telephone numbers are equivalent if they have the same standard form. (They dial the same number.)Your company is compiling a directory of telephone numbers from local businesses. As part of the quality control process you want to check that no two (or more) businesses in the directory have the same telephone number."
b"How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated in the figure below."
b"Larry graduated this year and finally has a job. He's making a lot of money, but somehow never seems to have enough. Larry has decided that he needs to grab hold of his financial portfolio and solve his financing problems. The first step is to figure out what's been going on with his money. Larry has his bank account statements and wants to see how much money he has. Help Larry by writing a program to take his closing balance from each of the past twelve months and calculate his average account balance."
b'Fred Mapper is considering purchasing some land in Louisiana to build his house on. In the process of investigating the land, he learned that the state of Louisiana is actually shrinking by 50 square miles each year, due to erosion caused by the Mississippi River. Since Fred is hoping to live in this house the rest of his life, he needs to know if his land is going to be lost to erosion.After doing more research, Fred has learned that the land that is being lost forms a semicircle. This semicircle is part of a circle centered at (0,0), with the line that bisects the circle being the X axis. Locations below the X axis are in the water. The semicircle has an area of 0 at the beginning of year 1. (Semicircle illustrated in the Figure.)'
b"Some people believe that there are three cycles in a person's life that start the day he or she is born. These three cycles are the physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles, and they have periods of lengths 23, 28, and 33 days, respectively. There is one peak in each period of a cycle. At the peak of a cycle, a person performs at his or her best in the corresponding field (physical, emotional or mental). For example, if it is the mental curve, thought processes will be sharper and concentration will be easier.Since the three cycles have different periods, the peaks of the three cycles generally occur at different times. We would like to determine when a triple peak occurs (the peaks of all three cycles occur in the same day) for any person. For each cycle, you will be given the number of days from the beginning of the current year at which one of its peaks (not necessarily the first) occurs. You will also be given a date expressed as the number of days from the beginning of the current year. You task is to determine the number of days from the given date to the next triple peak. The given date is not counted. For example, if the given date is 10 and the next triple peak occurs on day 12, the answer is 2, not 3. If a triple peak occurs on the given date, you should give the number of days to the next occurrence of a triple peak."
b"One measure of ``unsortedness'' in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out of order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence ``DAABEC'', this measure is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ``AACEDGG'' has only one inversion (E and D)---it is nearly sorted---while the sequence ``ZWQM'' has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be---exactly the reverse of sorted).You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences containing only the four letters A, C, G, and T). However, you want to catalog them, not in alphabetical order, but rather in order of ``sortedness'', from ``most sorted'' to ``least sorted''. All the strings are of the same length."
b'During his last sabbatical, professor M. A. Ya made a surprising discovery about the old Maya calendar. From an old knotted message, professor discovered that the Maya civilization used a 365 day long year, called Haab, which had 19 months. Each of the first 18 months was 20 days long, and the names of the months were pop, no, zip, zotz, tzec, xul, yoxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, koyab, cumhu. Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called uayet and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Maya believed that this month was unlucky, the court of justice was not in session, the trade stopped, people did not even sweep the floor.For religious purposes, the Maya used another calendar in which the year was called Tzolkin (holly year). The year was divided into thirteen periods, each 20 days long. Each day was denoted by a pair consisting of a number and the name of the day. They used 20 names: imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau and 13 numbers; both in cycles.Notice that each day has an unambiguous description. For example, at the beginning of the year the days were described as follows:1 imix, 2 ik, 3 akbal, 4 kan, 5 chicchan, 6 cimi, 7 manik, 8 lamat, 9 muluk, 10 ok, 11 chuen, 12 eb, 13 ben, 1 ix, 2 mem, 3 cib, 4 caban, 5 eznab, 6 canac, 7 ahau, and again in the next period 8 imix, 9 ik, 10 akbal . . .Years (both Haab and Tzolkin) were denoted by numbers 0, 1, : : : , where the number 0 was the beginning of the world. Thus, the first day was:Haab: 0. pop 0Tzolkin: 1 imix 0Help professor M. A. Ya and write a program for him to convert the dates from the Haab calendar to the Tzolkin calendar.'
b"IONU Satellite Imaging, Inc. records and stores very large images using run length encoding. You are to write a program that reads a compressed image, finds the edges in the image, as described below, and outputs another compressed image of the detected edges.A simple edge detection algorithm sets an output pixel's value to be the maximum absolute value of the differences between it and all its surrounding pixels in the input image. Consider the input image below:The upper left pixel in the output image is the maximum of the values |15-15|,|15-100|, and |15-100|, which is 85. The pixel in the 4th row, 2nd column is computed as the maximum of |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-175|, |175-25|, |175-175|,|175-175|, and |175-25|, which is 150.Images contain 2 to 1,000,000,000 (109) pixels. All images are encoded using run length encoding (RLE). This is a sequence of pairs, containing pixel value (0-255) and run length (1-109). Input images have at most 1,000 of these pairs. Successive pairs have different pixel values. All lines in an image contain the same number of pixels."
b"Have you done any Philately lately?You have been hired by the Ruritanian Postal Service (RPS) to design their new postage software. The software allocates stamps to customers based on customer needs and the denominations that are currently in stock.Ruritania is filled with people who correspond with stamp collectors. As a service to these people, the RPS asks that all stamp allocations have the maximum number of different types of stamps in it. In fact, the RPS has been known to issue several stamps of the same denomination in order to please customers (these count as different types, even though they are the same denomination). The maximum number of different types of stamps issued at any time is twenty-five.To save money, the RPS would like to issue as few duplicate stamps as possible (given the constraint that they want to issue as many different types). Further, the RPS won't sell more than four stamps at a time."

b"The Joseph's problem is notoriously known. For those who are not familiar with the original problem: from among n people, numbered 1, 2, . . ., n, standing in circle every mth is going to be executed and only the life of the last remaining person will be saved. Joseph was smart enough to choose the position of the last remaining person, thus saving his life to give us the message about the incident. For example when n = 6 and m = 5 then the people will be executed in the order 5, 4, 6, 2, 3 and 1 will be saved.Suppose that there are k good guys and k bad guys. In the circle the first k are good guys and the last k bad guys. You have to determine such minimal m that all the bad guys will be executed before the first good guy."
b'Sally Jones has a dozen Voyageur silver dollars. However, only eleven of the coins are true silver dollars; one coin is counterfeit even though its color and size make it indistinguishable from the real silver dollars. The counterfeit coin has a different weight from the other coins but Sally does not know if it is heavier or lighter than the real coins.Happily, Sally has a friend who loans her a very accurate balance scale. The friend will permit Sally three weighings to find the counterfeit coin. For instance, if Sally weighs two coins against each other and the scales balance then she knows these two coins are true. Now if Sally weighsone of the true coins against a third coin and the scales do not balance then Sally knows the third coin is counterfeit and she can tell whether it is light or heavy depending on whether the balance on which it is placed goes up or down, respectively.By choosing her weighings carefully, Sally is able to ensure that she will find the counterfeit coin with exactly three weighings.'
b'Marsha and Bill own a collection of marbles. They want to split the collection among themselves so that both receive an equal share of the marbles. This would be easy if all the marbles had the same value, because then they could just split the collection in half. But unfortunately, some of the marbles are larger, or more beautiful than others. So, Marsha and Bill start by assigning a value, a natural number between one and six, to each marble. Now they want to divide the marbles so that each of them gets the same total value. Unfortunately, they realize that it might be impossible to divide the marbles in this way (even if the total value of all marbles is even). For example, if there are one marble of value 1, one of value 3 and two of value 4, then they cannot be split into sets of equal value. So, they ask you to write a program that checks whether there is a fair partition of the marbles.'
b"In Frobnia, a far-away country, the verdicts in court trials are determined by a jury consisting of members of the general public. Every time a trial is set to begin, a jury has to be selected, which is done as follows. First, several people are drawn randomly from the public. For each person in this pool, defence and prosecution assign a grade from 0 to 20 indicating their preference for this person. 0 means total dislike, 20 on the other hand means that this person is considered ideally suited for the jury.Based on the grades of the two parties, the judge selects the jury. In order to ensure a fair trial, the tendencies of the jury to favour either defence or prosecution should be as balanced as possible. The jury therefore has to be chosen in a way that is satisfactory to both parties.We will now make this more precise: given a pool of n potential jurors and two values di (the defence's value) and pi (the prosecution's value) for each potential juror i, you are to select a jury of m persons. If J is a subset of {1,..., n} with m elements, then D(J ) = sum(dk) k belong to Jand P(J) = sum(pk) k belong to J are the total values of this jury for defence and prosecution.For an optimal jury J , the value |D(J) - P(J)| must be minimal. If there are several jurys with minimal |D(J) - P(J)|, one which maximizes D(J) + P(J) should be selected since the jury should be as ideal as possible for both parties.You are to write a program that implements this jury selection process and chooses an optimal jury given a set of candidates."
b'"Kronecker\'s Knumbers" is a little company that manufactures plastic digits for use in signs (theater marquees, gas station price displays, and so on). The owner and sole employee, Klyde Kronecker, keeps track of how many digits of each type he has used by maintaining an inventory book. For instance, if he has just made a sign containing the telephone number "5553141", he\'ll write down the number "5553141" in one column of his book, and in the next column he\'ll list how many of each digit he used: two 1s, one 3, one 4, and three 5s. (Digits that don\'t get used don\'t appear in the inventory.) He writes the inventory in condensed form, like this: "21131435".The other day, Klyde filled an order for the number 31123314 and was amazed to discover that the inventory of this number is the same as the number---it has three 1s, one 2, three 3s, and one 4! He calls this an example of a "self-inventorying number", and now he wants to find out which numbers are self-inventorying, or lead to a self-inventorying number through iterated application of the inventorying operation described below. You have been hired to help him in his investigations.Given any non-negative integer n, its inventory is another integer consisting of a concatenation of integers c1 d1 c2 d2 ... ck dk , where each ci and di is an unsigned integer, every ci is positive, the di satisfy 0<=d1<d2<...<dk<=9, and, for each digit d that appears anywhere in n, d equals di for some i and d occurs exactly ci times in the decimal representation of n. For instance, to compute the inventory of 5553141 we set c1 = 2, d1 = 1, c2 = 1, d2 = 3, etc., giving 21131435. The number 1000000000000 has inventory 12011 ("twelve 0s, one 1").An integer n is called self-inventorying if n equals its inventory. It is called self-inventorying after j steps (j>=1) if j is the smallest number such that the value of the j-th iterative application of the inventory function is self-inventorying. For instance, 21221314 is self-inventorying after 2 steps, since the inventory of 21221314 is 31321314, the inventory of 31321314 is 31123314, and 31123314 is self-inventorying.Finally, n enters an inventory loop of length k (k>=2) if k is the smallest number such that for some integer j (j>=0), the value of the j-th iterative application of the inventory function is the same as the value of the (j + k)-th iterative application. For instance, 314213241519 enters an inventory loop of length 2, since the inventory of 314213241519 is 412223241519 and the inventory of 412223241519 is 314213241519, the original number (we have j = 0 in this case).Write a program that will read a sequence of non-negative integers and, for each input value, state whether it is self-inventorying, self-inventorying after j steps, enters an inventory loop of length k, or has none of these properties after 15 iterative applications of the inventory function.'
b'A factory produces products packed in square packets of the same height h and of the sizes 1*1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4, 5*5, 6*6. These products are always delivered to customers in the square parcels of the same height h as the products have and of the size 6*6. Because of the expenses it is the interest of the factory as well as of the customer to minimize the number of parcels necessary to deliver the ordered products from the factory to the customer. A good program solving the problem of finding the minimal number of parcels necessary to deliver the given products according to an order would save a lot of money. You are asked to make such a program.'

b'The 2D-Nim board game is played on a grid, with pieces on the grid points. On each move, a player may remove any positive number of contiguous pieces in any row or column. The player who removes the last piece wins. For example, consider the left grid in the following figure.The player on move may remove (A), (B), (A, B), (A, B, C), or (B,F), etc., but may not remove (A, C), (D, E), (H, I) or (B, G).For purposes of writing 2D-Nim-playing software, a certain programmer wants to be able to tell whether or not a certain position has ever been analyzed previously. Because of the rules of 2D-Nim, it should be clear that the two boards above are essentially equivalent. That is, if there is a winning strategy for the left board, the same one must apply to the right board. The fact that the contiguous groups of pieces appear in different places and orientations is clearly irrelevant. All that matters is that the same clusters of pieces (a cluster being a set of contiguous pieces that can be reached from each other by a sequence of one-square vertical or horizontal moves) appear in each. For example, the cluster of pieces (A, B, C, F, G) appears on both boards, but it has been reflected (swapping left and right), rotated, and moved. Your task is to determine whether two given board states are equivalent in this sense or not.'
b"We usually think that there are three geometric dimensions; the fourth dimension is usually time. However, the Association for Customizing Machines (ACM) has to deal with four geometrical dimensions for their strange customer EE3 who needs to pack four dimensional products into perpendicular parallelepipeds before shipping them to the newly emerged market niche just on the outskirts of the Milky Way.Each of EE3 products consists of a number of unit 4D cubes that are glued together at their faces. A face of a 4D cube is a 3D cube and each 4D cube has 8 such faces. The picture on the left shows a 4D cube projected into a plane with the four principal, orthogonal axes shown. It takes a bit of effort to stretch our imagination and see the faces of a 4D cube in such a projection. The pictures below try to illustrate how the two faces along each of the four axes are situated in 4D. Again, using just the planar projection it is not so easy to illustrate and takes some effort to see. But we have done a good job, didn't we?Each EE3 product to be packed consists of a number of unit 4D cubes that are glued together along their faces which are 3D cubes. Your job is simple: find the minimal volume measured in the number of unit 4D cubes of a perpendicular parallelepiped (a 4D box) into which the product can be packed before shipping."
b"In a k bit 2's complement number, where the bits are indexed from 0 to k-1, the weight of the most significant bit (i.e., in position k-1), is -2^(k-1), and the weight of a bit in any position i (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < k-1) is 2^i. For example, a 3 bit number 101 is -2^2 + 0 + 2^0 = -3. A negatively weighted bit is called a negabit (such as the most significant bit in a 2's complement number), and a positively weighted bit is called a posibit.A Fun number system is a positional binary number system, where each bit can be either a negabit, or a posibit. For example consider a 3-bit fun number system Fun3, where bits in positions 0, and 2 are posibits, and the bit in position 1 is a negabit. (110)Fun3 is evaluated as 2^2-2^1 + 0 = 3. Now you are going to have fun with the Fun number systems! You are given the description of a k-bit Fun number system Funk, and an integer N (possibly negative. You should determine the k bits of a representation of N in Funk, or report that it is not possible to represent the given N in the given Funk. For example, a representation of -1 in the Fun3 number system (defined above), is 011 (evaluated as 0 - 2^1 + 2^0), andrepresenting 6 in Fun3 is impossible."
b'Tester ProgramFor this contest, we first designed the following problem (note that you do not have to solve it!):Another Wall in the MazeIn ACM/ICPC contests, you\'ll often see questions such as "find the shortest path out of this maze." Let\'s turn this on its head and ask "given a path, find a maze for which the given path is the shortest path." Our paths will run vertically and horizontally between the regularly spaced points of a rectangular grid. The problem is to compute a set of unit-length baffles (walls) separating grid points that forces the given path to be the unique shortest path from its starting point to the end point. To make things more interesting, we will require that there should be no redundant walls constructed in the sense that it should not be possible to remove any wall and still have the given path as the unique shortest path. In the following figure for example, consider the path through the 8 ? 5 grid on the left maze of the top row. The wall placements in the two mazes to its right (top row) make that path unique. The two mazes on the lower row are faulty.The path is not unique in the one on the left, and there are some redundant walls on the right.Input (of the original problem)The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case consists of two integers W and H (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W, H \xe2\x89\xa4 100) giving the width and height of the grid respectively. The second line of the test case contains a path. The path always starts in the lowerleft corner, (0, 0). It is specified as a string of U (up), D (down), L (left), and R (right) characters (with no embedded white space). You may assume that the path remains within the bounds of the maze and does not intersect itself. It may end anywhere in the maze (i.e., not necessarily in a corner or against a wall).Output (of the original problem)First line of the output for the i-th test case (starting from one) should contain an integer M, the number of walls used in the solution. Following the first line, there are M lines each containing a wall specification in the form of four consecutive integers corresponding to two pairs of (x, y) coordinates specifying adjacent grid points separated by the wall (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x < W and 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 y < H). Note that the possible output is not unique. There should no blank line in the output.Sample Input (of the original problem)28 5RRRUULLURRRRDDRRUUU4 3RRRUUSample Output (of the original problem)190 0 0 11 0 1 12 0 2 12 1 3 13 0 4 03 1 4 13 2 4 23 2 3 32 2 2 34 2 4 30 3 0 41 3 1 42 3 2 43 3 3 44 3 4 45 3 5 45 3 6 35 2 6 26 1 6 222 2 3 22 2 2 1This is the end of the original problem statement! Being lazy, we did not want to spend time to write a tester program for this problem, and decided to have you write this for us!Write a program that receives both input and output as one input test case, and write as output CORRECT or INCORRECT to indicate whether or not the output is correct.'
